                        <p>The Textbook Resale projectâ€™s goal is to provide a reliable, easy service to UVic students that allows them to buy and sell textbooks for their courses. Currently, students are using services such as Facebook, UsedVictoria, and Craigslist to buy and sell their used textbooks. None of these services provide all of the features that students want: the most impactful of which is the ability to search for textbooks by course. Using a similar model as existing services, but combining only the best of each, the Textbook Resale project aims to give students the best service and experience of buying and selling used textbooks.</p>
			<p>Existing services such as Facebook, UsedVictoria, and Craigslist provide a way of buying and selling any item. None of them provide features specific to textbooks other than generic categorization. Facebook in particular, being a social network and not an online marketplace, does even less in terms of a good user experience. Establishing a single marketplace for used textbooks means that students only need to post their advertisement once. In addition, the experience can be tailored specifically to students selling textbooks, such as categorizations based on class and instructor or notes on the differences between editions. This phase of the project consists of defining the stakeholders, high-level requirements, and a hierarchical task analysis. It will set the stage for the design phase, where everything will be broken down into smaller bits and more clearly defined.</p>
