                        <h2>Buyer</h2>
                        <p>Joey is a 23 year male currently attending UVic. He lives with a friend currently, and is about a 10 minutes walk from UVic’s main campus. He works part-time on the weekends, but most of his money goes towards living expenses such as rent and food. Typically he gets student loans to cover his tuition and textbooks. He’s always looking to save some money where he can, so he prefers to buy used textbooks. Joey is used to searching through a number of different sites to find the best deal on a particular book. It’s time consuming, but there’s no better option. Being a third year student of geography, he’s quite proficient with computers, but wouldn’t call himself a, ‘power user’.</p>
						<p>
							Goals:
							<ul>
								<li>Search for a specific book as efficiently as possible</li>
								<li>Find the best deal</li>
								<li>Have confidence throughout the buying process</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

                        <h2>Seller</h2>
                        <p>Rebecca just started her masters in civil engineering at UVic. She finished her undergraduate degree just last semester. She hung on to all of her textbooks hoping they might be useful in the future. Much to her disappointment, they’ve all just collected dust on her bookshelf. She’s 25 years old, and lives with her boyfriend. She works for the city on a part-time contract, building up hours for her professional engineering designation. She takes home a decent wage, but is always looking to save a bit where she can. She’d love to get rid of her old textbooks, but feels that just giving them away would be a missed opportunity. Being busy with work and studying means she has very little time to post them all online. She never manages to make the time to bring them to the textbook buyback either. Rebecca is very proficient with computers, her education and work often revolve around various complicated pieces of software and hardware.</p>
						<p>
							Goals:
							<ul>
								<li>Be able to list a large number of textbooks extremely efficiently</li>
								<li>Receive a fair price</li>
								<li>Have a quick and convenient sale</li>
							</ul>
